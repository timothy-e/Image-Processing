# Image-Processing
An experiment with converting an image to a series of lines.

The end goal is to partner with someone in Mechanical Engineering to create a machine that takes in vectors and physically draws them on paper.

Features to implement:
  Circular/Angled lines
  Different densities of lines for different luminosities
  Backtracking to find the most efficient way of converting an image to lines
  
In the far future, possibly breaking the vectors into CMYK and then swapping out writing instruments on the machine that creates these.
